read_qplib.f90       fortran subroutine to read a .qplib file into
                     a fortran 90 structure.

test_read_qplib.f90  a test program for read_qplib.f90

runtest_fortran      a Linux script to compile the fortran files and
                     then to run the test on a specified zipped .qplib file.
                     The syntax is
                       runtest_fortran filename
                     where filename is a .qplib[.gzip] file

qplib2lp.f90         fortran program to translate a .qplib file into
                     ILOG (CPLEX) lp format. The .qplib format should
                     be read from standard input, and the resulting lp
                     file will be written to standard output

lp2qplib.f90         fortran program to translate an ILOG (CPLEX) lp format
                     file into .qplib format should. The .lp file should be
                     read from standard input, and the resulting qplib
                     file will be written to a file whose name is that
