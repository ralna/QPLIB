TORSIONE

    The quadratic elastic torsion problem

    The problem comes from the obstacle problem on a square.

    The square is discretized into (px-1)(py-1) little squares. The
    heights of the considered surface above the corners of these little
    squares are the problem variables,  There are px**2 of them.

    The dimension of the problem is specified by Q, which is half the
    number discretization points along one of the coordinate
    direction.
    Since the number of variables is P**2, it is given by 4Q**2

    This is a variant of the problem stated in the report quoted below.
    It corresponds to the problem as distributed in MINPACK-2.
