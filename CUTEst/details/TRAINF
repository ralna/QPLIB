TRAINF

    This is an optimal control problem.
    The problem is to minimize the energy spent to move a train
    from the beginning of a flat track to its end in a given time.  The train
    is slowed down by some drag (assumed to be quadratic in the the velocity).
    The control variables are the acceleration force (UA) and the braking
    force (UB) applied on the train.
