OPTCTRL6

    An optimal control problem

    This problem is a modification of OPTCNTRL.  All bound constraints
    were removed.  At the solution, the bounds on U1-U9 are active,
    so a penalty term was added to the objective:

         mu * ||u(i) - active_bound||

    The value of mu (TDP_mu) was chosen to be very large, making the
    Hessian of the objective ill-conditioned.
