OPTCDEG3

    An optimal control problem determining the applied force
    that restores a cubically damped spring-mass system to equilibrium
    as fast as possible, given bounds on state and control variables.
    The displacement of the mass from equilibrium is x, velocity is y,
    and the controlling force is u.  The objective function also differs
    slightly from that of OPTCDEG2.
