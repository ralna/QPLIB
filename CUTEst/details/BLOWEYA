BLOWEYA

    A nonconvex quadratic program proposed by
    James Blowey (University of Durham)

    Given function v(s) and f(s) = v(s) + A(inv) v(s), s in [0,1],
    minimize

         (u(s) - v(s))(trans) ( A + A(inv) ) u(s) - (u(s) - v(s))(trans)f(s)

    where

       u(s) in [-1,1] and int[0,1] u(s) ds = int[0,1] v(s) ds

    and A is the

       "- Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions on a uniform mesh"

    The troublesome term A(inv) u(s) is replaced by the additional
    variable w(s) and the constraint A w(s) = u(s)

    The function v(s) is chosen to be

   1  ----         ----
          \       /
           \     /
            \   /
  -1         ---

    Thus the problem is formulated as the nonconvex QP

    minimize

         u(s) (trans) A u(s) + u(s) (trans) w(s) -
         v(s)(trans) A u(s) - 2.0 v(s)(trans) w(s) -
         u(s)(trans) v(s) + constant (ignored)

    subject to A w(s) = u(s),
               u(s) in [-1,1],
           and int[0,1] u(s) ds = 1 + a + b - c - d

    Case A: a = 0.2, b = 0.4, c = 0.6 and d = 0.8.
