GOULDQP3

    Source: a variant on a problem of optimal knot placement in a
    scheme for ordinary differential equations with boundary values
    suggested by J. R. Kightley, see N. I. M. Gould, "An algorithm for
    large-scale quadratic programming", IMA J. Num. Anal (1991),
    11, 299-324, problem class 3. Note that the optimal solution values
    given in that paper are incorrect.
