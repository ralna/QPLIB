OPTMASS

    A constrained optimal control problem
    adapted from Gawande and Dunn

    The problem is that of a particle of unit mass moving on a
    frictionless plane under the action of a controlling force whose
    magnitude may not exceed unity. At time=0, the particle moves through
    the origin of the plane in the direction of the positive x-axis with
    speed SPEED.  The cost function incorporates two conflicting control
    objectives, namely: maximization of the particle's final (at time=1)
    distance from the origin and minimization of its final speed.  By
    increasing the  value of the penalty constant PEN, more stress can be
    placed on the latter objective.

    Gawande and Dunn originally use a starting point (in the control
    only) that is much closer to the solution than the one chosen
    here.
