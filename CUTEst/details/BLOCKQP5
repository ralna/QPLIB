BLOCKQP5

    A nearly degenerate, non-convex quadratic program with some structure.

    The objective function is of the form

       sum (i=1,n) (i/n) ( x_i y_i ) + sum(j=1,b) z_j^2

    (cf BLOCKQP1.SIF where the factor (i/n) is missing).
    There are n equality constraints of the form

         x_i + y_i + sum (j=1,b) z_j = b

    There is an inequality constraint of the form

       sum(i=1,n) x_i + y_i + sum(j=1,b) z_j >= b + 1

    Finally, there are simple bounds

          1 <= x_i, y_i <= 1    (i=1,n)
          0 <= z_j <= 1         (j=1,b)

    (cf BLOCKQP3.SIF where the constraint 0 <= z_j <= 2)
