RDW2D51F

    A finite-element approximation to the distributed optimal control problem

       min 1/2||u-v||_L2^2 + beta ||f||_L2^2

    subject to - nabla^2 u = f

    where v is given on and within the boundary of a unit [0,1] box in
    2 dimensions, and u = v on its boundary. The discretization uses
    quadrilateral elememts. There are simple bounds on the controls f

    The problem is stated as a quadratic program
