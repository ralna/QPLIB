SOSQP1

    A non-convex quadratic program which is always
    second-order sufficient

    The objective function is of the form

       sum (i=1,n) x_i y_i

    There are n equality constraints of the form

         x_i - y_i = 1

    and another equality constraint of the form

         sum x_i + sum y_i = n

    Finally, there are simple bounds

        -1 <= x_i, y_i <= 1    (i=1,n)
