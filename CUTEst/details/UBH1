UBH1

    The problem is to minimize the integral of the control magnitude needed
    to bring a vehicle, from given position and velocity, to the origin with
    zero velocity in a fixed amount of time.  The controls are the components
    of the vehicle acceleration.  It is a quadratic linear problem.
    The discretization uses the trapezoidal rule.

    The problem is convex.
