    "A strategy for global convergence in a sequential
     quadratic programming algorithm",
    SINUM 26(3), pp. 600-623, 1989.

    The problem as stated in the paper seems to contain a typo.
    The sign of the x3 squared term in the first constraint has been
    set to + instead of - in order to ensdure that the problem is
    bounded below and the optimal point stated recovered.

    The problem is not convex.
