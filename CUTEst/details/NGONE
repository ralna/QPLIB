    Find a polygon of maximal area, under the constraint that no two of
    its vertices are further apart than 1.  The considered class of polygons
    has one vertex fixed at the origin and one of its neighbouring vertices
    constrained to lie on the horizontal axis.  Furthermore, vertices
    must have increasing abscissas, which implies that the polygons are
    of the form

                      ---*-----*-*
                     *            \
                    /              *
                   /                \
                   *-----------------*
