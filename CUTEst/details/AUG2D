AUG2D

    An expanded system formulation of a 2-D PDE system.

    A five-point discretization of Laplace's equation in a
    rectangular domain may be expressed in the form

          - M v = b,

    where M = sum a_i a_i^T. Letting A = (a_1 .... a_m),
    this system may be expanded as

           ( I   A^T ) (x) = (0),
           ( A    0  ) (v)   (b)

    which is then equivalent to solving the EQP
    minimize 1/2 || x ||_2^2   s.t.    A x = b

    In this variant, we replace the leading I block in the
    above formulation with a zero-one diagonal matrix D.
    This corresponds to certain boundary conditions.
    The resulting QP is thus convex but not strictly convex.
