KISSING2

    Problem: A second formulation of the KISSING NUMBER PROBLEM

    Source: This problem is associated to the family of Hard-Spheres
    problem. It belongs to the family of sphere packing problems, a
    class of challenging problems dating from the beginning of the
    17th century which is related to practical problems in Chemistry,
    Biology and Physics. Given a fixed unit sphere at the origin in R^n,
    the problem consists of arranging a further m unit spheres so that
    sum of the distances to these spheres is as small as possible.
    This problem may be reduced to a nonconvex nonlinear optimization
    problem with a potentially large number of (nonoptimal) points
    satisfying optimality conditions. We have, thus, a class of problems
    indexed by the parameters m and n, that provides a suitable
    set of test problems for evaluating nonlinear programming codes.
    After some algebric manipulations, we can formulate this problem as

               m
     Minimize sum <p_i,p_i> - m n
              i=1

     subject to

      <p_i - p_j, p_i - p_j> >= 4 for all different pair of indices i, j

      and

      <p_i, p_i> >= 4 for all indices i

      as well as n(n-1)/2 normalisation constraints fixing components.

      The goal is to find an objective value equal to 0.
