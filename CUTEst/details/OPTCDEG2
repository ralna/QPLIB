OPTCDEG2

    An optimal control problem determining the applied force
    that restores a damped spring-mass system to equilibrium
    as fast as possible, given bounds on state and control
    variables.  The displacement of the mass from equilibrium
    is x, velocity is y, and the controlling force is u.
