    Problem:
    ********

    A linear least-sqaure problem with k-convex constraints

       min (1/2) || f(t) - x ||^2

    subject to the constraints
       _
       \/_k  x  >=  0,

    where  f(t) and  x  are vectors in (n+k)-dimensional space.

    We choose f(t) = sin(t), x(1) >= 0.08 and fix x(n+i) = 0
