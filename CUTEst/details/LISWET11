LISWET11

    A k-convex approximation problem posed as a
    convex quadratic problem, with variable dimensions.

    Formulation:
    -----------

                 n+k             2
    minimize 1/2 sum ( x  - c  )
                 i=1    i    i

    subject to

                  k              k-i
                 sum ( k ) ( -1 )    x     > 0
                 i=0 ( i )            j+i  =

    where c  = g( t ) + small perturbation, t  = (i-1)/(n+k-1)
           i       i                         i

    Case 11: g(t) = cos(2 pi t)

    NB. Perturbations are not random as Li and Swetits's
        random number generator is undefined.
