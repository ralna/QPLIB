BT4

    Source: a variant of problem 4 in
    P.T. Boggs and J.W. Tolle,
    "A strategy for global convergence in a sequential
     quadratic programming algorithm",
    SINUM 26(3), pp. 600-623, 1989.

    The original problem seems to be unbounded.  The contribution of
    x3 in the first constraint has been squared instead of cubed.

    The problem is not convex.
