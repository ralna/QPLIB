EIGENB2

    --------

    Solving symmetric eigenvalue problems as systems of
    nonlinear equations.

    The problem is, given a symmetric matrix A, to find an orthogonal
    matrix Q and diagonal matrix D such that A Q(T) = Q(T) D.

    Example B: a tridiagonal matrix with diagonals 2 and off diagonals -1
