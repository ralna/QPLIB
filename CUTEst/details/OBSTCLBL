OBSTCLBL

    A quadratic obstacle problem by Dembo and Tulowitzki

    The problem comes from the obstacle problem on a rectangle.
    The rectangle is discretized into (px-1)(py-1) little rectangles. The
    heights of the considered surface above the corners of these little
    rectangles are the problem variables,  There are px*py of them.
